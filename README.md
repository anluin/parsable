# Parsable

Parsable is an experimental library designed to explore possibilities for implementing a parser framework using
generator functions in TypeScript. The goal of Parsable is to provide a flexible and modular approach to parsing streams
of input, whether it's text, bytes, or any other data type. By leveraging generator functions, Parsable aims to offer
an intuitive and chainable API for parsing operations.
